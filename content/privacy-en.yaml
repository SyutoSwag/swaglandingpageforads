      This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used by SWAG when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, therefore we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

      Information You Provide to Us

      We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive messages, including photos or videos taken via our Services ("SWAG"), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your username, password, email address, phone number, age, gender and any other information you choose to provide.

      We kindly suggest you to provide contents (such as messages, photos, videos, captions) which you own the copyright. We cannot prevent others from making copies of your contents (e.g., by taking a screenshot). You should not use SWAG to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.

      Information we receive from others

      In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
      - Other Users: Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.
      - Social Media: You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your SWAG account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.
