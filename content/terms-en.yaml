      ABOUT SWAG

      SWAG is a pay-to-view social messaging application service that allows users to create, publish and potentially earn money for their exclusive photos and videos.

      These Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy (collectively, these "Terms"), govern your use of SWAG. BY USING SWAG, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, or if you are dissatisfied with SWAG for any reason, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of SWAG.

      We reserve the right to make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will endeavor to notify you of the changes, such as by posting a notice directly within the SWAG app and/or on official website, or by any other reasonable method. Also, we may ask you to affirmatively agree to these Terms as modified (e.g., by pressing an "I Agree" button) at the time of your next login on SWAG. By continuing to use SWAG after such notice and/or acceptance, you agree to be bound by these Terms as modified.

      When using SWAG, you are communicating with us electronically, and you consent to receiving communications from us electronically, including emails, push messages and in-app messages. You acknowledge and agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

      By using SWAG, you acknowledge and agree that standard carrier charges may apply and that depending on your wireless service plan, your wireless carrier may impose data and/or other charges when you use SWAG, and that any and all such charges will solely be your responsibility.

      We reserve the right at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without liability to you, to: (i) modify, suspend or terminate SWAG or any portion thereof; (ii) restrict, limit, suspend or terminate your access to SWAG or any portion thereof; (iii) remove, block or disable any content you post on SWAG; (iv) monitor your use of SWAG (including any content or message you post or transmit on SWAG) to verify compliance with these Terms and/or any applicable law; and (v) investigate any suspected or alleged misuse or unlawful use of SWAG and cooperate with law enforcement in such investigation.
      HOW SWAG WORKS

      SWAG lets you create and publish your photos and videos for access by your followers on SWAG. You can also follow and access photos and videos of other SWAG users. SWAG users can send private messages to one another. When users create photos/videos using the SWAG camera function, such content is "exclusive" to SWAG and can only be viewed within the SWAG app and cannot be shared or exported outside of the SWAG app.

      Upon creating a photo or video (the "Content") on SWAG, the content creator (the "Creator") can make that content accessible to his/her followers (the "Followers") either at no charge ("free content") or for a charge ("premium content"). For a premium content item, the Creator will designate a certain number of "SWAG points" that he/she wishes to charge for the item, and SWAG will charge a platform service fee. To access the item, a Follower will need to acquire the requisite total number of SWAG points indicated for that item by making an in-app purchase of the equivalent dollar value based on the then-current applicable exchange rate published on SWAG.

      You can check the SWAG Point balance (the "Balance") in your account on SWAG. Your Balance includes: (i) SWAG Points you have purchased but not yet used toward purchases of access to other Creators' premium contents. If SWAG deletes any content in accordance with the provisions of the law or the Creator request, the user shall not be able to discuss it; (ii) SWAG Points that you have earned from other Followers' in-app purchases of access to your premium content, and Followers gifted you (the "Earnings").
      WHO CAN USE SWAG

      SWAG is an entertainment platform for respectful and responsible grown-ups. IMPORTANT NOTE: As a general policy, we do not tolerate child sexual abuse material on SWAG and any user account that violates this policy will be deactivated immediately.

      By using SWAG, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age; (ii) you will fully comply with these Terms; (iii) you accept full responsibility for the use of SWAG on any device, whether or not it is owned by you; (iv) you accept full responsibility for any User Content created or provided by you; and (v) your use of SWAG will not violate these Terms or any applicable law.
      ACCOUNT REGISTRATION

      Account registration is required to access and use SWAG. To register on SWAG, you must provide a valid email address, a username, and a password. During account registration, you also have the ability to create a SWAG profile and import your preexisting content to be a part of your SWAG profile. Note that as part of the account registration process, we may ask for your mobile phone number for account verification purposes.

      You are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur on your account. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your login details and agree to immediately notify us if you believe someone has used or is using your account without your permission or any other breach of security is brought to your attention.
      IN-APP PURCHASES

      To access another's premium content item on SWAG, you must acquire the requisite total number of SWAG Points indicated for that item by making an in-app purchase of the equivalent dollar value. In-app purchases for SWAG Points are handled through the applicable app store. The applicable app store may charge you a sales tax depending on where you live, and please check the app store's terms and policies for details.

      IMPORTANT NOTE: All in-app purchases of SWAG Points are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. By making an in-app purchase of SWAG Points to access a premium item on SWAG, you expressly acknowledge and agree that neither the Creator of such premium item nor we will have any obligation or liability to provide you with a refund for any reason. You also agree that we will make the necessary adjustment to correct the error in your Balance only when SWAG software or technical glitch has resulted in an error in your Balance.
